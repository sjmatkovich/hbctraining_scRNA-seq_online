Approximate time: 

## Learning Objectives:

* Understand how cellranger is run and what the ouputs are
* Create plots will cellranger metrics
* Review the Cellranger geneerated QC report (web summary HTML)

# Single-cell RNA-seq: Quality control of Cellranger output

## Cellranger

* Talk about what it is
* Provide code and what parameters are
* Talk about output (directory structure); refer to the files we read in for [QC setup]()https://github.com/hbctraining/scRNA-seq_online/blob/4day_scrnaseq/lessons/03_SC_quality_control-setup.md
